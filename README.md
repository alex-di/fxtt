# Test task
Hello, fellow developers!

Tests for this task obviously won't work because documentation provided for the task doesn't describe process of exchanging auth token for payer id, which is required for initial payment creation.

Also, having a payer field in the requests is a bit wierd, unless we are allowing a client to interact with other people accounts somehow (why would we do that?).

Anyway, you should get clear idea of my approaches for developing simple SDKs.

Cheers!
